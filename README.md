# Spectrum IQ infusion pump : Varification and Validation
________________________________________
Overview

This document describes the verification and validation (V&V) framework for Baxter Spectrum Infusion Pumps when integrated with DeviceBridge v4.3.8.
The goal is to ensure:
•	Compliance with FDA 21 CFR 820.30 (Design Control), IEC 62304 (software lifecycle), ISO 14971 (risk management), and IEC 60601/62366 (safety & usability).
•	Reliable, safe, and accurate data ingestion from Spectrum pumps into hospital systems (DeviceBridge, EMR, Nurse Call, Vault Mobile).
•	End-to-end confirmation that both design requirements (Verification) and user needs (Validation) are satisfied.

Verification 

Scope  
•	Software ingestion services (K8s pods, YAML configs).  
•	Communication interfaces (MDAP, DeviceBridge APIs).  
•	Drug library synchronization.  
•	Alarm/event propagation.  
•	Data storage in PostgreSQL/MongoDB.  

Verification Activities:

1.	Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM): Map each Spectrum requirement → test case → evidence.
2.	Interface Verification:
o	Confirm MDAP → DeviceBridge → DB message flow.
o	Verify communication protocols (TCP/UDP, ports, retry logic).
3.	Functional Verification:
o	Pump start, stop, rate change → DB update within 2 sec.
o	Alarm messages (occlusion, air-in-line, door open, battery low).
o	Infusion complete/end-of-dose messages.
4.	Drug Library Sync Verification:
o	Ensure latest drug library version loads correctly on pumps.
o	Check DeviceBridge confirms sync status.
5.	Database Verification:
o	Validate schema consistency for pump telemetry and alerts.
o	Confirm no message duplication or loss.
6.	Test Tools:
o	Simulated Spectrum pump gateway.
o	Automated ingestion verification scripts (Python/Splunk queries).

Deliverables: Verification Protocols, Test Scripts, Verification Report.

Validation

Scope
•	End-to-end infusion workflow from pump → DeviceBridge → hospital systems.
•	Usability and human factors (nurse workflows, alarm acknowledgment).
•	Integration with EMR, Vault Mobile, and Nurse Call.

Validation Activities:
1.	Clinical Workflow Testing:  
o	Program infusion on Spectrum pump → verify infusion event appears in DeviceBridge and downstream systems.    
o	Modify infusion rate → confirm update accuracy in <2 sec.    
2.	Alarm Validation:  
o	Simulate occlusion, air-in-line, near-end infusion → verify alarm in Vault Mobile/Nurse Call.  
o	Check alarm text, priority, and timestamp correctness.  
3.	Drug Library Validation:  
o	Program infusion with restricted drug → verify pump blocks it per library rules.  
o	Confirm validation alerts appear in DeviceBridge logs.  
4.	Load & Soak Validation:  
o	100+ concurrent Spectrum pumps over 12–24 hrs.  
o	Validate no message loss, stable performance under load.  
5.	Human Factors Validation:  
o	Nurse acknowledgment of alarms via Vault Mobile.  
o	Check that clinical users can interpret alerts easily.  

Deliverables: Validation Protocols, Clinical Simulation Results, Validation Report.

Test Plan Summary     

•	Load Testing: High-volume pump connections.    
•	Soak Testing: Extended duration with alarms + infusions.    
•	Functional Testing: Infusion workflows, alarms, drug library sync.    
•	Usability Testing: Nurse workflows and alarm handling.

Validation & Verification Metrics  
Metric	Target Value	Notes  
Infusion update latency	< 2 seconds	Pump → DB → Dashboard  
Alarm propagation accuracy	> 99%	Must match pump alarms exactly  
Data loss rate	< 0.1%	Across all ingestion services  
Drug library sync success rate	100%	All pumps receive latest library  
Uptime during soak test	> 99.9%	No service downtime
